## What it is

Brute doesn't like the current state of the web. It's too fluffy and political. Brute offers an opinionated and restrictive approach to layout. At the core it is a fuild CSS grid with 2 breakpoints and a few utility classes. It plays well with `boot.css` an anti design - design system designed by [@slrncl](https://slrncl.com/boot/) for his own projects.
